<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_4 c006'>WHEN I awoke the next morning, it
seemed as if all the events of the
preceding evening had been a dream,
and nothing but the identity of the
ancient chamber convinced me of their reality.
While I lay musing on my pillow, I
heard the sound of little feet pattering
outside of the door, and a whispering consultation.
Presently a choir of small voices
chanted forth an old Christmas carol, the
burden of which was:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rejoice, our Saviour He was born</div>
      <div class='line'>On Christmas Day in the morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I rose softly, slipped on my clothes, opened
the door suddenly, and beheld one of the
most beautiful little fairy groups that a
painter could imagine.</p>

<p class='c007'>It consisted of a boy and two girls, the
eldest not more than six, and lovely as
seraphs. They were going the rounds of
the house, and singing at every chamber
door; but my sudden appearance frightened
them into mute bashfulness. They remained
for a moment playing on their lips
with their fingers, and now and then stealing
a shy glance from under their eyebrows,
until, as if by one impulse, they scampered
away, and as they turned an angle of the
gallery, I heard them laughing in triumph
at their escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The house was surrounded with evergreens,
according to the English custom,
which would have given almost an appearance
of summer; but the morning was
extremely frosty; the light vapour of the
preceding evening had been precipitated by
the cold, and covered all the trees and every
blade of grass with its fine crystallisations.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had scarcely dressed myself, when a
servant appeared to invite me to family
prayers. He showed me the way to a small
chapel in the old wing of the house, where
I found the principal part of the family
already assembled in a kind of gallery, furnished
with cushions, hassocks, and large
prayer-books; the servants were seated on
benches below. The old gentleman read
prayers from a desk in front of the gallery,
and Master Simon acted as clerk, and made
the responses.</p>

<div id='i3'  class='figcenter id005'>
<a href='images/il03.jpg'><img src='images/i003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his delight</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The service was followed by a Christmas
carol, which Mr. Bracebridge himself had
constructed from a poem of his favourite
author, Herrick; and it had been adapted
to an old church melody by Master Simon.
As there were several good voices among
the household, the effect was extremely
pleasing; but I was particularly gratified by
the exaltation of heart, and sudden sally of
grateful feeling, with which the worthy
Squire delivered one stanza: his eyes glistening,
and his voice rambling out of all
the bounds of time and tune:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Tis thou that crown’st my glittering hearth</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With guiltlesse mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And giv’st me wassaile bowles to drink,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Spiced to the brink:</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord, ’tis Thy plenty-dropping hand,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That soiles my land;</div>
      <div class='line'>And giv’st me for my bushell sowne,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Twice ten for one.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Our breakfast consisted of what the Squire
denominated true old English fare. He
indulged in some bitter lamentations over
modern breakfasts of tea and toast, which
he censured as among the causes of modern
effeminacy and weak nerves, and the decline
of old English heartiness; and though he
admitted them to his table to suit the palates
of his guests, yet there was a brave display
of cold meats, wine, and ale, on the
sideboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast I walked about the
grounds with Frank Bracebridge and Master
Simon. We were escorted by a number of
gentlemanlike dogs, that seemed loungers
about the establishment; from the frisking
spaniel to the steady old staghound; the
last of which was of a race that had been
in the family time out of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old mansion had a still more venerable
look in the yellow sunshine than by
pale moonlight; and I could not but feel
the force of the Squire’s idea, that the
formal terraces, heavily moulded balustrades,
and clipped yew trees, carried with
them an air of proud aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we were talking we heard the distant
toll of the village bell, and I was told
that the Squire was a little particular in
having his household at church on a Christmas
morning; considering it a day of
pouring out of thanks and rejoicing; for,
as old Tusser observed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At Christmas be merry, <i>and thankful withal</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feast thy poor neighbours, the great and the small.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘If you are disposed to go to church,’
said Frank Bracebridge, ‘I can promise you
a specimen of my cousin Simon’s musical
achievements. As the church is destitute
of an organ, he has formed a band from
the village amateurs, and established a musical
club for their improvement; he has also
sorted a choir, as he sorted my father’s pack
of hounds, according to the directions of
Jervaise Markham, in his “Country Contentments”;
for the bass he has sought out all
the “deep solemn mouths,” and for the
tenor the “loud ringing mouths,” among the
country bumpkins; and for “sweet mouths”
he has culled with curious taste among
the prettiest lasses in the neighbourhood;
though these last, he affirms, are the most
difficult to keep in tune.’</p>

<p class='c007'>As the morning, though frosty, was remarkably
fine and clear, the most of the
family walked to the church, which was a
very old building of grey stone, and stood
near a village, about half a mile from the
park gate. Adjoining it was a low snug
parsonage, which seemed coeval with the
church. As we passed this sheltered nest,
the parson issued forth and preceded us.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had expected to see a sleek, well-conditioned
pastor, such as is often found in a
snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron’s
table; but I was disappointed. The parson
was a little, meagre, black-looking man,
with a grizzled wig that was too wide, and
stood off from each ear; so that his head
seemed to have shrunk away within it, like
a dried filbert in its shell. He wore a rusty
coat, with great skirts, and pockets that
would have held the church Bible and
prayer-book; and his small legs seemed
still smaller, from being planted in large
shoes decorated with enormous buckles.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was informed by Frank Bracebridge
that the parson had been a chum of his
father’s at Oxford, and had received this
living shortly after the latter had come to
his estate. He was a complete black-letter
hunter, and would scarcely read a work
printed in the Roman character. The editions
of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde
were his delight; and he was indefatigable
in his researches after such old English
writers as have fallen into oblivion from
their worthlessness. He had pored over
these old volumes so intensely, that they
seemed to have been reflected into his
countenance indeed; which, if the face be
an index of the mind, might be compared
to a title-page of black-letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>On reaching the church porch, we found
the parson rebuking the grey-headed sexton
for having used mistletoe among the greens
with which the church was decorated. It
was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned
by having been used by the Druids in their
mystic ceremonies; and though it might
be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting
of halls and kitchens, yet it had
been deemed by the Fathers of the Church
as unhallowed, and totally unfit for sacred
purposes. So tenacious was he on this
point, that the poor sexton was obliged to
strip down a great part of the humble trophies
of his taste, before the parson would
consent to enter upon the service of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interior of the church was venerable
but simple; on the walls were several mural
monuments of the Bracebridges, and just
beside the altar was a tomb of ancient workmanship,
on which lay the effigy of a
warrior in armour, with his legs crossed, a
sign of his having been a crusader. I was
told it was one of the family who had signalised
himself in the Holy Land, and the
same whose picture hung over the fireplace
in the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The orchestra was in a small gallery, and
presented a most whimsical grouping of
heads, piled one above the other, among
which I particularly noticed that of the
village tailor, a pale fellow with a retreating
forehead and chin, who played on the
clarionet, and seemed to have blown his
face to a point; and there was another, a
short pursy man, stooping and labouring
at a bass viol, so as to show nothing but
the top of a round bald head, like the egg
of an ostrich. There were two or three
pretty faces among the female singers, to
which the keen air of a frosty morning had
given a bright rosy tint; but the gentlemen
choristers had evidently been chosen like
old Cremona fiddles, more for tone than
looks; and as several had to sing from the
same book, there were clusterings of odd
physiognomies, not unlike those groups of
cherubs we sometimes see on country
tombstones.</p>

<div id='i4'  class='figcenter id006'>
<a href='images/il04.jpg'><img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Winding all up by a nasal solo</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The usual services of the choir were
managed tolerably well. But the great trial
was an anthem that had been prepared and
arranged by Master Simon, and on which
he had founded great expectation. Unluckily
there was a blunder at the very
outset; the musicians became flurried;
Master Simon was in a fever; everything
went on lamely and irregularly until they
came to a chorus beginning ‘Now let us
sing with one accord,’ which seemed to be
a signal for parting company: all became
discord and confusion; each shifted for
himself, and got to the end as well, or
rather as soon, as he could, except one old
chorister in a pair of horn spectacles bestriding
and pinching a long sonorous nose;
who, happening to stand a little apart, and
being wrapped up in his own melody, kept
on a quavering course, wriggling his head,
ogling his book, and winding all up by a
nasal solo of at least three bars’ duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parson gave us a most erudite
sermon on the rites and ceremonies of
Christmas, and the propriety of observing
it not merely as a day of thanksgiving, but
of rejoicing. He kindled into warmth with
the ardour of his contest, and the host of
imaginary foes with whom he had to
combat; had a stubborn conflict with old
Prynne and two or three other forgotten
champions of the Roundheads, on the subject
of Christmas festivity; and concluded
by urging his hearers, in the most solemn
and affecting manner, to stand to the traditionary
customs of their fathers, and feast
and make merry on this joyful anniversary
of the Church.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have seldom known a sermon attended
apparently with more immediate effects;
for, on leaving the church, the congregation
seemed one and all possessed with the
gaiety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by
their pastor. The elder folks gathered in
knots in the churchyard, greeting and
shaking hands; and the children ran about
crying, Ule! Ule! and repeating some uncouth
rhymes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ule! Ule!</div>
      <div class='line'>Three puddings in a pule;</div>
      <div class='line'>Crack nuts and cry ule!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>which the parson, who had joined us,
informed me had been handed down from
days of yore. The villagers doffed their
hats to the Squire as he passed, giving him
the good wishes of the season with every
appearance of heartfelt sincerity, and were
invited by him to the Hall, to take something
to keep out the cold of the weather;
and I heard blessings uttered by several of
the poor, which convinced me that, in the
midst of his enjoyments, the worthy old
cavalier had not forgotten the true Christmas
virtue of charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our way homeward his heart seemed
overflowing with generous and happy feelings.
As we passed over a rising ground
which commanded something of a prospect,
the sounds of rustic merriment now and
then reached our ears; the Squire paused
for a few moments, and looked around with
an air of inexpressible benignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was something truly cheering in
this triumph of warmth and verdure over
the frosty thraldom of winter; it was, as
the Squire observed, an emblem of Christmas
hospitality, breaking through the chills
of ceremony and selfishness, and thawing
every heart into a flow. He pointed with
pleasure to the indications of good cheer
reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable
farmhouses and low, thatched cottages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Squire went on to lament the deplorable
decay of the games and amusements
which were once prevalent at this season
among the lower orders, and countenanced
by the higher: when the old halls of castles
and manor-houses were thrown open at
daylight; when the tables were covered
with brawn, and beef, and humming ale;
when the harp and the carol resounded all
day long, and when rich and poor were
alike welcome to enter and make merry.</p>

<div id='i5'  class='figcenter id005'>
<a href='images/il05.jpg'><img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The dinner was served up in the Great Hall</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>LO, NOW IS COME THE JOYFUL’ST FEAST!</div>
      <div class='line'>LET EVERY MAN BE JOLLY,</div>

      <div class='line'>AND EVERY POST WITH HOLLY.</div>

      <div class='line'>AND ALL THEIR SPITS ARE TURNING.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We had not been long home when the
sound of music was heard from a distance.
A band of country lads, without coats, their
shirt-sleeves fancifully tied with ribands,
their hats decorated with greens, and clubs
in their hands, were seen advancing up the
avenue, followed by a large number of villagers
and peasantry. They stopped before
the hall door, where the music struck up
a peculiar air, and the lads performed a
curious and intricate dance, advancing, retreating,
and striking their clubs together,
keeping exact time to the music; while one,
whimsically crowned with a fox’s skin, the
tail of which flaunted down his back, kept
capering around the skirts of the dance, and
rattling a Christmas box with many antic
gesticulations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the dance was concluded, the whole
party was entertained with brawn and beef,
and stout home-brewed. The Squire himself
mingled among the rustics, and was
received with awkward demonstrations of
deference and regard.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true, I perceived two or three of
the younger peasants, as they were raising
their tankards to their mouths when the
Squire’s back was turned, making something
of a grimace, and giving each other the
wink; but the moment they caught my eye
they pulled grave faces, and were exceedingly
demure. With Master Simon, however,
they all seemed more at their ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bashfulness of the guests soon gave
way before good cheer and affability. When
the Squire had retired, the merriment increased,
and there was much joking and
laughter, particularly between Master Simon
and a hale, ruddy-faced, white-headed farmer,
who appeared to be the wit of the village:
for I observed all his companions to wait
with open mouths for his retorts, and burst
into a gratuitous laugh before they could
well understand them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole house, indeed, seemed abandoned
to merriment. As I passed to my
room to dress for dinner, I heard the sound
of music in a small court, and, looking
through a window that commanded it, I
perceived a band of wandering musicians,
with pandean pipes and tambourine; a
pretty, coquettish housemaid was dancing
a jig with a smart country lad, while several
of the other servants were looking on. In
the midst of her sport the girl caught a
glimpse of my face at the window, and,
colouring up, ran off with an air of roguish
affected confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had finished my toilet, and was loitering
with Frank Bracebridge in the library, when
we heard a distant thwacking sound, which
he informed me was a signal for the serving
up of the dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dinner was served up in the great
hall, where the Squire always held his
Christmas banquet. A blazing, crackling fire
of logs had been heaped on to warm the
spacious apartment, and the flame went
sparkling and wreathing up the wide-mouthed
chimney. The great picture of
the crusader and his white horse had been
profusely decorated with greens for the occasion;
and holly and ivy had likewise been
wreathed around the helmet and weapons
on the opposite wall. Before these stood
the two Yule candles, beaming like two stars
of the first magnitude: other lights were
distributed in branches, and the whole array
glittered like a firmament of silver.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were ushered into this banqueting
scene with the sound of minstrelsy, the old
harper being seated on a stool beside the
fireplace, and twanging his instrument with
a vast deal more power than melody.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parson said grace, which was not a
short, familiar one, such as is commonly
addressed to the Deity in these unceremonious
days; but a long, courtly, well-worded
one of the ancient school.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was now a pause, as if something
was expected; when suddenly the butler
entered the hall with some degree of bustle;
he was attended by a servant on each side
with a large wax-light, and bore a silver
dish, on which was an enormous pig’s head,
decorated with rosemary, with a lemon in
its mouth, which was placed with great
formality at the head of the table. The
moment this pageant made its appearance,
the harper struck up a flourish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though prepared to witness many of
these little eccentricities, from being apprised
of the peculiar hobby of mine host;
yet, I confess, the parade with which so
odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed
me, until I gathered from the conversation
of the Squire and the parson that
it was meant to represent the bringing in
of the boar’s head: a dish formerly served
up with much ceremony, and the sound
of minstrelsy and song, at great tables on
Christmas Day. ‘I like the old custom,’
said the Squire, ‘not merely because it is
stately and pleasing in itself, but because
it was observed at the College of Oxford,
at which I was educated. When I hear
the old song chanted, it brings to mind the
time when I was young and gamesome--and
the noble old college-hall--and my
fellow-students loitering about in their
black gowns: many of whom, poor lads,
are now in their graves!’</p>

<p class='c007'>The table was literally loaded with good
cheer, and presented an epitome of country
abundance, in this season of overflowing
larders. A distinguished post was allotted
to ‘ancient sirloin,’ as mine host termed it:
being, as he added, ‘the standard of old
English hospitality, and a joint of goodly
presence, and full of expectation.’</p>

<div id='i6'  class='figcenter id007'>
<a href='images/il06.jpg'><img src='images/i006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The little beings were as happy about him as the mock fairies about Falstaff</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the cloth was removed, the butler
brought in a huge silver vessel of rare and
curious workmanship, which he placed before
the Squire. Its appearance was hailed
with acclamation; being the Wassail Bowl,
so renowned in Christmas festivity. The
contents had been prepared by the Squire
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old gentleman’s whole countenance
beamed with a serene look of indwelling
delight, as he stirred this mighty bowl.
Having raised it to his lips, with a hearty
wish of a merry Christmas to all present,
he sent it brimming, around the board, for
every one to follow his example, according
to the primitive style; pronouncing it ‘the
ancient fountain of good feeling, where all
hearts meet together.’</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much laughing and rallying,
as the honest emblem of Christmas joviality
circulated, and was kissed rather coyly by
the ladies. When it reached Master Simon
he raised it in both hands, and with the
air of a boon companion, struck up an old
Wassail chanson:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>The browne bowle,</div>
      <div class='line'>The merry browne bowle.</div>

      <div class='line in8'>Fling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be as merry as a king,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sound a lusty laugh-a.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c008'><sup>[A]</sup></a></div>

</div>
<hr class='c009' />
<p class='c010'>The dinner-time passed away in this flow
of innocent hilarity; and, though the old
hall may have resounded in its time with
many a scene of broader rout and revel,
yet I doubt whether it ever witnessed more
honest and genuine enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ladies had retired, the conversation,
as usual, became still more animated.
The Squire told several long stories of early
college pranks and adventures.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found the tide of wine and wassail fast
gaining on the dry land of sober judgment.
The company grew merrier and louder as
their jokes grew duller. Master Simon was
in as chirping a humour as a grasshopper
filled with dew; his old songs grew of a
warmer complexion, and he began to talk
maudlin about the widow.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the dinner-table was removed, the
hall was given up to the younger members
of the family, who made its old walls ring
with their merriment, as they played at
romping games. Master Simon, who was
the leader of their revels, and seemed on
all occasions to fulfil the office of that ancient
potentate, the Lord of Misrule, was
blinded in the midst of the hall. The little
beings were as busy about him as the mock
fairies about Falstaff; pinching him, plucking
at the skirts of his coat, and tickling
him with straws.</p>

<p class='c007'>When I returned to the drawing-room,
I found the company seated around the fire,
listening to the parson, who was deeply
ensconced in a high-backed oaken chair.
From this venerable piece of furniture,
with which his shadowy figure and dark
weazen face so admirably accorded, he was
dealing forth strange accounts of popular
superstitions and legends of the surrounding
country, with which he had become
acquainted in the course of his antiquarian
researches. He gave us several anecdotes
of the fancies of the neighbouring peasantry,
concerning the effigy of the crusader
which lay on the tomb by the church altar.
It was said to get up from the tomb and
walk the rounds of the churchyard in
stormy nights, particularly when it thundered.
Some talked of gold and jewels
buried in the tomb, over which the spectre
kept watch; and there was a story current
of a sexton in old times who endeavoured
to break his way to the coffin at night;
but just as he reached it, received a violent
blow from the marble hand of the effigy,
which stretched him senseless on the pavement.
From these and other anecdotes
that followed, the crusader appeared to be
the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout
the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whilst we were all attention to the parson’s
stories, our ears were suddenly assailed
by a burst of heterogeneous sounds
from the hall, in which was mingled something
like the clang of rude minstrelsy,
with the uproar of many small voices and
girlish laughter. The door suddenly flew
open, and a train came trooping into the
room, that might almost have been mistaken
for the breaking up of the court of Fairy.
That indefatigable spirit, Master Simon, in
the faithful discharge of his duties as Lord
of Misrule, had conceived the idea of a
Christmas mummery, or masking. The old
housekeeper had been consulted; the antique
clothes-presses and wardrobes rummaged
and made to yield up the relics of
finery that had not seen the light for several
generations.</p>

<div id='i7'  class='figcenter id008'>
<a href='images/il07.jpg'><img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Master Simon led the van</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Master Simon led the van, as ‘ancient
Christmas,’ quaintly apparelled in a ruff, a
short cloak, which had very much the
aspect of one of the old housekeeper’s
petticoats, and a hat that might have served
for a village steeple, and must indubitably
have figured in the days of the Covenanters.
From under this his nose curved boldly
forth, flushed with a frost-bitten bloom, that
seemed the very trophy of a December blast.
He was accompanied by the blue-eyed romp,
dished up as ‘Dame Mince-Pie,’ in the venerable
magnificence of faded brocade, long
stomacher, peaked hat, and high-heeled
shoes. The rest of the train had been
metamorphosed in various ways; the girls
trussed up in the finery of the ancient belles
of the Bracebridge line, and the striplings
bewhiskered with burnt cork, and gravely
clad in broad skirts, hanging sleeves, and
full-bottomed wigs, to represent characters
celebrated in ancient maskings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The irruption of this motley crew, with
beat of drum, according to ancient custom,
was the consummation of uproar and merriment.
Master Simon covered himself with
glory by the stateliness with which, as
Ancient Christmas, he walked a minuet
with the peerless, though giggling, Dame
Mince-Pie. It was followed by a dance of all
the characters--a medley of quaint costumes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The worthy Squire contemplated these
fantastic sports, and the resurrection of
his old wardrobe, with the simple relish
of childish delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>But enough of Christmas and its gambols;
it is time for me to pause in this
garrulity. In writing to amuse, if I fail,
the only evil is my own disappointment.
If, however, I can by any lucky chance,
in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle
from the brow of care, or beguile the heavy
heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can
now and then penetrate through the gathering
film of misanthropy, prompt a benevolent
view of human nature, and make
my reader more in good humour with his
fellow-beings and himself, surely, surely, I
shall not then have written entirely in vain.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
